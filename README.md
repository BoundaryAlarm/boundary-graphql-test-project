# Boundary GraphQL Exercise

Use this skeleton application to complete your assigned task, it demonstrates a few concepts we use here at boundary and shows type-graphql, typeORM, typeDI and simple DAO based abstraction for database queries

## Install the Application

### Requirements

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Postgres

### Running the App
From the project root directory, simply type `npm install `to install the dependencies needed for this project.

To build the application, invoke webpack and pass in your desired environment target, eg.

`NODE_ENV=development npm run build`

This will generate a semi-minified and transpiled artifact of your Typescript code.

To run the application, you can use your process manager of choice, or use the default by typing `npm run start`

The server & Apollo Playground will be available at http://localhost:8088/api

Have fun!
